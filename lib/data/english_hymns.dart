3. Grant us, then, pure heart and patience
That, in all we do or say,
Little souls our deeds may copy,
And be never led astray;
Little feet our steps may follow
In a safe and narrow way.

    '''
4. When our growing sons and daughters
Look on life with eager eyes,
Grant us then a deeper insight,
And new powers of sacrifice:
Hope to trust them, faith to guide them
Love that nothing good denies.

5. May we keep our holy calling
Stainless in its fair renown,
That, when all the work is over,
And we lay the burden down,
Then the children Thou hast given
Still may be our joy crown.

    '''
1. O Happy home, where Thou art loved the dearest,
Thou loving friend and Saviour of our race,
And where among the guests there never cometh
One who can hold such high and honoured place!
''',
    '''
2. Happy home, where two in heart united
In holy faith and blessed hope are one,
Whom death a little while alone divideth,
And cannot end the union here begun!
''',
    '''
3. Happy home, whose little ones are given
Early to Thee, in humble faith and prayer,
To thee, their friend, who from the heights of heaven
Guides them, and guards with more than mother’s care!
''',
    '''
4. Happy home, where Thou art not forgotten,
When joy is overflowing, full and free,
O happy home, where every wounded spirit
Is brought, physician, comforter, to Thee.
